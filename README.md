## 🧭 Description  

**Harara** is a machine learning–powered **heatwave forecasting and early-warning system** built to help communities in **South Sudan** anticipate and respond to extreme heat events.  
The project integrates **Google Earth Engine (GEE)** satellite data, a **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** deep learning model, a **FastAPI backend**, and a **Flutter mobile app** to provide **7-day-ahead heatwave forecasts** and actionable alerts.
